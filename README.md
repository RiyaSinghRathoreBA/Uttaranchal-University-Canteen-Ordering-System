### Project Overview:
The Canteen Ordering System (COS) is an online platform designed to streamline the process of ordering food from the college canteen.

**Improve Customer Experience:** Minimize wait times and increase service speed.
**Optimize Inventory Management:** Track stock levels and prevent food wastage.
